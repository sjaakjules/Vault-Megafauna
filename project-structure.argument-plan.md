## Significance: More-than-human knowledge management

The unfolding environmental crisis calls for better understanding and management of the Earthâ€™s habitats. The ever-increasing amount of data humans gather about the planet is a common strategy for the assessment of the impact and the planning of remediation. Our research seeks to expand the notion of knowledge management to include nonhuman lifeforms as empowered contributors to collective storytelling. We argue that this redefinition of data, storytelling and knowledge is necessary in the era where human-centred approaches fail to address ecological devastation. 

Our example is giant *E. regnans* trees in Tasmania. These organisms grow to become some of of the tallest and most massive organisms in the world, and are critically important habitats for many forms of life. Increasing bushfires due to climate change pose an ongoing existential threat. For instance, the 2018-2019 bushfire killed over 50% of Tasmania's trees over 90m and significantly injured many more. Due to the immense time-periods it takes for these trees to grow (500-700 years), experts say that we may never see such trees again.

Mostly as a result of the work of local activist, new giant trees have been discovered and stands of them have been afforded protection due to their campaigns. Such work is needed as Tasmania's regnans forests are still logged. While trees over 85 meters are legislatively protected, large volume trees are not. Many of these trees are older and more massive than the tallest trees but may have lost some height due to lightning strikes and other environmental factors. Furthermore, this legislation does not protect younger *E. regnans* trees, threatening the next generation of giant trees. Activists, ecologists and others seek to document Tasmania's giant trees to increase their recognition aand preserve information about these rapidly disappearing structures. 

Our ongoing research has collected high resolution data describing these and other large old trees and we learn ways to read their meaning. There are many challenges to collecting this data  due to the trees' size, structural complexity and remote locations. Furthermore, understanding meaning is an open and difficult challenge because elements of ecosystems mean different things to different inhabitants. We suggest that humans can only find answers to these questions through an approach that invites contributions not only from humans but also from birds, trees, and others. 

## Gap: Integrating More-than-human knowledge is an open and difficult challenge

Recent work emphasise that knowledge is better understood as clusters that are different, partial, problematic, and heterogenous. For instance, researchers increasingly understand the interdisciplinary nature (crossing scientific disciplines, crossing into the humanities, etc) of environmental challenges. Further research acknowledges the benefits of integrating the diverse forms ecological knowledge can take. For instance, knowledge about ecological management can take the form of formal scientific hypothesis-testing but is also retained and expressed in longer periods of time through practices such as indigenous story-telling and other cultural memories.

The next step is recognising that  clusters of knowledge are not limited to humans. Nonhumans have forms of knowledge too. Traces of these clusters -- or knowledge objects -- are expressed in genes, patterns of behaviour, and nonhuman cultures. The differences can be large due to different evolutionary backgrounds, life histories, mutual (in)visibilities, and the inherently incompatible needs of different lifeforms.

TODO: insert specific examples of more-than-human knowledge clusters

In this context, human sensibilities, technologies, and languages do not suffice. Issue of knowledge and knowledge representation, communication (participation), retention (placement)

- Subjectivity, points of view, biases, coupling, etc.
- Incompleteness.
- Privledge of knowledge communicated through human language.
- Goal orientation and biases from that

## Opportunity: More-than-human storytelling

Inclusiveness.

Knowledge management systems create...an environment allows us to glue content together content that is resolved at different levels and extract interesting stories (needs to be inclusive, participatory, action-based).

Stories.

TODO: Write opportunity

## Research Question

How can more-than-human knowledge be organised and expressed to maximise inclusivity about nonhuman places and lifeforms?

## Hypothesis

[1.2] Technologically amplified [2] stories [3] can help to [1.3.1] capture, [1.3.2] make inclusive and [1.3.3] communicate [3] human and more-than-human forms of [1] knowledge.

## Methods

### 1. Define More-than-human Knowledge Management

Create an environment that supports the capturing, clustering and organisation of knowledge irrespective of its origin, stakeholders and level of resolution.

1. Define knowledge in this more-than-human context.

    1. Understanding what knowledge is
    2. Knowledge communication (participation)
    3. Knowledge retention (placement)

2. Review precedents in open-source, agile software environments, etc.

3. Identify key goals and establish template

    1. Source-Agnostic
    2. Inclusive
    3. Open communication

### 2. Create Stories

Populate this environment with traces of more-than-human knowledge. Organise this more-than-human knowledge knowledge in particular ways by focusing on specific datasets and operations.

1. Identify the need to to tell stories. 

2. Propose an initial definition of stories by reviewing existing stories in the human domain. Distinguish one story from another (poem, essay, an epic saga. All human and confined. Trans-species psychology).

3. Show how our understanding of stories which includes nonhumans can be extended with some kind of systemicity to include these actors and speeches and objects.
TODO: How?

4. Demonstrate that this story-telling can be systematic, substantiated and innovative compared with what exist now. Demonstrate we can tell from this approach are substantially different from those in the human domain (while retaining the power of storytelling, training and techniques)
TODO: How?

### 3. Establish Benefits

1. Demonstrate concrete benefits by focusing on particular stories.
2. Verify findings by exposing to ... 

## Findings

### 1. Template for More-than-human Knowledge Management

1. More-than-human knowledge

TODO: describe several compact but concrete examples @alexrfholland @sjaakjules

2. Knowledge Objects

    <!--- define broader account of knowledge clusters so we can link together our speculative imagination about parrots in 10,000 years with protests about Indigenous mother trees with the terrestrial lidar scanning.  --->

    Information exchange situated patterns. They can take the form of:

    - knowledge processes (behaviour, evolutionary processes)
    - compact processes (events)
    - artefacts (books, digital datasets).

    Others (cf. sensory ecologies, nonhuman cultures, nonhuman learning, etc.):

    TODO: Knowledge object examples: [[themes.sensory-ecologies]], [[themes.imagination]], [[themes.justice]] 
    what else?

3. Speech Agents

    <!--- 
    We want to include different stakeholders. Our system and approach doesn't have epistemic bias.
    
    Well, it does, unavoidably. the point is to highlight and resist it. It is agnostic to the source. The ambition is to allow anyone to speak (this speaking can be dreamy, statistical, as a scientific paper).

    The system is willing to consider at face value any contributions, and then reject those  it considers poor quality, or reject their use for a particular purpose.
    
    But the system is trying to account for them all and honestly. Tries to find what is good/caring/inclusive/just? and glues this together. 
    
    Artists would do some kind of actions, scientists would do others. Nonhumans can't but can engage it certain ways. We want to be inclusive so we want to consider it, even though we focus on human expert interpretation. 
    <!--- nonhumans definitely have speech of some kind. which? represented here how? --->

4. Speech Acts

    <!--- Focus on specific datasets and operations. We do this to provide glimpses in this overall way of interpreting things in the domain of more-than-human research.

### 2. Stories / Knowledge Traces / Relationships.

1. Definition of Stories.

Stories express [[project-structure.relationships]]. They increase/decrease [[friction]] between objects so a stakeholder might look at something they usually would not.
### 3. Demonstration of concrete benefits:

1. Support for new stakeholders, flexibility, empathy, ie. [[stories.uncertainty]].

2. Capturing events otherwise unrecorded, ie. [[stories.decay]].

3. Ability to cope with time and spatial scales, ie. [[stories.strangeness]].

4. Ability to cope with non-individual life-forms, with subtle community relationships,ie. [[stories.self-selves]]

## Analysis of Findings

1. Limitations
2. Applications to other work.
3. New research questions


## Contribution to Knowledge

1. New conceptual models for preserving information about habitats for conservation and ecological understanding (conservation, ecology)
2. Communicating these remote, complex and often inaccessible encounters in an open, intuitive format (eco-literacy)
3. New tools for more-than-human communication (as part of steps from data generation to information-gathering to response) to help ecological design, interspecies and more-than-human participatory design in conditions of incomplete knowledge.
