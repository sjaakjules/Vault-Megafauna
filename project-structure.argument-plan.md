## More-than-human Knowledge Management

## Objective


## Signficance

The unfolding environmental crisis calls for better understanding and management of the Earthâ€™s habitats. The ever-increasing amount of data humans gather about the planet is a common strategy for the assessment of the impact, the documentation of rapidly disappearing species, genes and structures, and the planning of remediation.

Our example is E. regnans trees. These organisms are the largest flowering plants in the world and provide crucially important as habitats for many forms of life. They are also dissapearing due to anthropogenic activities such as climate change and logging. Our ongoing research has collected high resolution data describing large old trees. We want to understand what knowledge is (patterns, data, information), capture traces of it, organise it to highlight relationships expressed within it, and learn ways to read its meaning. 

Knowledge is not complete but instead emerges as clusters of different, partial, problematic, heterogenous ways of storing it. For instance, recent work emphasises the importance of interdisciplinary work (crossing scientific disciplines, crossing into the humanities, etc) for dealing with environmental challenges. Further research acknolwedges the diverse forms ecological knowledge can take, and the benefits of embracing these many different forms given that many ecological processes extend far beyond typical human timescales. For instance, knowledge about ecological management can take the form of formal scientific hypothesis-testing but is also retained and expressed in longer periods of time through practices such as indigenous story-telling and other cultural memories.

The next step is recognising that  clusters of knowledge are not limited to humans. Nonhumans have forms of knowledge too. Traces of these clusters -- or knoweledge objects -- are expressed in genes, patterns of behaviour, and nonhuman cultures. In this context, human sensibilities, technologies, and languages do not suffice. Instead, the meaning should be informed by the knowledge from nonhuman others.

<!--- However, humans most frequently collect data for financial gain or other self-serving goals. The resulting description often flatten the natural world into resources and commodities, minimizing the richness and expressiveness of nonhuman life. ---> 

## Gap

The integration of nonhuman knowledge is an open and difficult challenge because elements of ecosystems mean different things to different inhabitants. The differences can be large due to different evolutionary backgrounds, life histories, mutual (in)visibilities, and the inherently incompatible needs of different lifeforms.

Issue of knowledge and knowledge representation, communication (participation), retention (placement)

    - Subjectivity, points of view, biases, coupling, etc.
    - Incompleteness.
    - Privledge of knowledge communicated through human language.
    - Goal orientation and biases from that

## Opportunity

Inclusiveness.

Knowledge management systems create...an environment allows us to glue content together content that is resolved at different levels and extract interesting stories (needs to be inclusive, participatory, action-based).

Stories.

## Research Question

How can nonhuman knowledge be organised to maximise inclusivity about nonhuman places and lifeforms?

## Hypothesis

[3] Stories [2] can help to [2.1] understand, [2.2] make inclusive and [2.3] communicate [3] human and more-than-human forms of [1] knowledge.

## Methods

We focus on specific datasets and operations. 

1. Describe the key issues about what knowledge is (patterns, data information, wisdom)

    1.1 Define knowledge in this more-than-human context

2. Create an environment that allows content to be clustered and organised, even if it is  resolved at different levels.  Establish a template that supports the capturing, clustering and organisation of this knowledge irrespective of its origin and stakeholders. 

Key goals:

    2.1 Source-Agnostic
    2.2 Inclusive
    2.3 Open communication

3. Express the relationships within these knowledge clustesr. Capturing traces and organise the more-than-human knowledge knowledge in particular ways by focusingon specific datasets and operations (Stories).

    3.1. Describe and identify the need to to tell stories. 

    3.2. Propose an initial definition of storeies by reviewign existing stories  in the human domain. Distinguish one story from another (poem, essay, an epic saga. All human and confined. Trans-species psychology).

    3.3. Show how our understanding of stories which includes nonhumans can be extended with some kind of systemicity to include these actors and speeches and objects.
    TODO: How?

    3.4. Demonstrate that this story-telling can be systematic, substantiated and innovative compared with what exist now. Demonstrate we can tell from this approach are substantially different from those in the human domain (while retaining the power of storytelling, training and techniques)
    TODO: How?

4. Demonstrate concrete benefits by focusing on particular stories. 
       
5. Verifying. Return. Drop back into teaching situations etc. Give back.

## Findings

1. More-than-human knowledge

    1.1 Understanding what knowledge is
    2.2 Knowledge communication (participation)
    2.3 Knowledge retention (placement)

[ ] describe several compact but concrete examples @alexrfholland @sjaakjules

2. Template for More-than-human knowledge management

    2.1 Knowledge Objects

    <!--- define broader account of knowledge clusters so we can link together our speculative imagination about parrots in 10,000 years with protests about Indigenous mother trees with the terrestrial lidar scanning.  
    
        --->

    Information exchange situated patterns. They can take the form of:

    - Processes
    - Compact Processes (events)
    - Artefacts

    Others (cf. sensory ecologies, nonhuman cultures, nonhuman learning, etc.):

    2.2 Speech Agents

    <!--- 
    We want to include different stakeholders. Our system and approach doesn't have epistemic bias.
    
    Well, it does, unavoidably. the point is to highlight and resist it. 
    
    It is agnostic to the source. The ambition is to allow anyone to speak (this speaking can be dreamy, statistical, as a scientific paper).

    The system is willing to consider at face value any contributions, and then reject those  it considers poor quality, or reject their use for a particular purpose.
    
    But the system is trying to account for them all and honestly. Tries to find what is good/caring/inclusive/just? and glues this together. 
    
    Artists would do some kind of actions, scientists would do others. Nonhumans can't but can engage it certain ways. We want to be inclusive so we want to consider it, even though we focus on human expert interpretation. 
    <!--- nonhumans definitely have speech of some kind. which? represented here how? --->

    2.3 Speech Acts

    <!--- Focus on specific datasets and operations. We do this to provide glimpses in this overall way of interpreting things in the domain of more-than-human research. 
    
    Needs to be inclusive, participatory, action-based). Bits and pieces. Relationships between them.--->

        - Technical Operations [[project-structure.framework.markers]].
        - Poetic Inteperations 

3. Knowledge Traces / Relationships / Stories

    3.1 Stories express [[project-structure.relationships]]. They increase/decrease [[friction]] between objects so a stakeholder might look at something they usually would not.
    3.2
    3.3
    3.4

4. Demonstration of concrete benefits:

     4.1 Support for new stakeholders, flexibility, empathy, ie. [[stories.uncertainty]].
     4.2 Capturing events otherwise unrecorded, ie. [[stories.decay]].
     4.3 Ability to cope with time and spatial scales, ie. [[stories.strangeness]].
     4.4 Ability to cope with non-individual life-forms, with subtle community relationships
        ,ie. [[stories.self-selves]]
        

## Analysis of Findings

1. Limitations
2. Applications to other work.
3. New research questions


## Contribution to Knowledge
1. New conceptual models for preserving information about habitats for conservation and ecological understanding (conservation, ecology)
2. Communicating these remote, complex and often inaccessible encounters in an open, intuitive format (eco-literacy)
3. New tools for more-than-human communication (as part of steps from data generation to information-gathering to response) to help ecological design, interspecies and more-than-human participatory design in conditions of incomplete knowledge.
