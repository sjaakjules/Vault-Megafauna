This story is about a Euclytpus regans canopy

>Every time you go to a giant tree you see something new in it and yourself. I see something that’s been alive hundreds of years before me and will be there hundreds of years after me. It’s humbling to consider all the years of my life are merely a small chapter of theirs. Climbing these trees is where I started. Up a tree you see things from a perspective no one else has ever seen.”

# Regans
>Eualypytus regnans, known more commonly as Mountain Ash or Swamp Gum, can grow to 100 metres tall and live for more than 500 years. For a long time this species held the record as the tallest flowering tree. But last year, a 100.8 m tall Yellow Meranti (Shorea faguetiana) in Borneo, claimed the title — surpassing our tallest Eucalypt, named Centrioun, by a mere 30 centimetres.
>
>Centrioun still holds the record as the tallest tree in the s`outhern hemisphere. But five species of Eucalypt also grow above 85 m tall, with many ranking among some of the tallest trees in the world.
>
>It’s not only their height that make these trees special, they’re also the most carbon dense forests in the world, with a single hectare storing more than 1,867 tonnes of carbon.
