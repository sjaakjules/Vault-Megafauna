### Technology

**Aerial LiDaR**

- Return intensity, isolates emergent crowns in forest
- Shadow simulation, emphasizes the volumes
- Elevation

**Terrestrial LidAR**

- Clustering, detect individual organisms
- Feature recognition (leaf, trunk, branches)

**IMBL**

- Density analysis
- Texture identification (rotting, living wood, etc)
- Surface analysis (roughness, complexity, fractal dimension)
- Pore space analysis (fissures, hollows)

### Additional data

1. Sounds
2. Photographs
3. Videos
4. Animations
5. Text

### Actions

1. Annotations and buttons, hierarchical
2. Animation paths
3. Zoom and rotate
4. Color changes
5. Sectional cuts

## Stages

1. Ecological communities
2. Topography
3. Climate
4. Fires
5. All known hits of trees 85+m tall.
6. Human disturbances (via google earth engine, etc)

### Low-energy IMBL beamline for imaging fine scales [10cm and 1cm]

1. Rotting internal walls
2. Bark substrate
