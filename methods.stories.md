## Criteria

1. Demonstrate that this kind of story telling is substantive..
- understand what stories exist in the human domain
- how our understanding of stories can be extended to include the nonhumans
- demonstrate how our stories are substantially different from the stories in the human domain, retaining the benefits of the human only stories

2. Demonstrate benefits
- new stakeholders, greater flexibilioty, unrecorded events, cope with spatial / time scales, non individual lifeforms, etc. 
- demonstrate some of the componens.

3. Clear reason to tell the story. Stories need to be told. 
- distinguish one story for another
- trans-species pyschology 

4. Return back to how we are going to verify this. 

## Goals
- improvisational - sit and observe the stories
- pattern formation across different scales, step in to this rich information flow, with human subjectivity and human aesthetic appreciation, what it might mean to different characters (scientist, indigenous, etc) -- allow the material to speak for themselves
- invite expert players? human or nonhuman
- 'disney style' narrative arc, mythology driven
- immersive meditation type driven, let the environment influence me....
