>There is a clear reason why philosophy of consciousness was abandoned and was replaced by the philosophy of language: It was not possible to reach a satisfactory definition of consciousness for many centuries until today, because of inescapable problems of definition. The various consciousness concepts of the last centuries met the pre-assumptions of humans as they defined themselves. But with the success story of neurobiology, it became clear that the term consciousness is an anthropo- centric construction to integrate the signalling interactions between several brain tissues in a unifying narrative. If some of the communication brain parts are deformed or damaged, consciousness looks rather strange, and the deficits in the different concepts of consciousness become obvious (Parvizi and Damasio 2001, 2003). For example, the generalizing term consciousness is like how we speak about the national character of, for example, Austria. But, Austria does not exist, except the 8 million people who coordinate and organize the Austrian lifeworld every day by communication processes that even may fail with unexpectable consequences.

>Because all quantitative models of communication—which are basically founded on hidden metaphysical assumptions (all-is-one holism or all-is-many atomism, physicalism, mechanicism, e.g. “cellular machinery”)—did not function to coher- ently explain how two interacting biotic agents can reach a common agreement on how to commonly coordinate, the philosophy of consciousness was replaced by the philosophy of language in a long-lasting discourse between 1920 and 1980 (Witzany 1995, 2000). The quantitative methods ignored the results of this discourse, because they could not reflect their own hidden metaphysical assumptions and got stuck in the narratives of subject-object split or similar narratives (body-mind duality), such as sender-receiver (coding-decoding) models.

>In the last decade, there arose a discussion about plant “cognition” or plant “consciousness”, because of their yet unknown capability for sensing, monitoring, learning, decision making, etc. (Baluška et al. 2006, 2010; Baluška and Mancuso 2009). Because all these capabilities critically depend on successful communication processes within the plant body, I would like to suggest some kind of “communica- tive identity”. This clearly differs from previous assumptions such as mathematical theories of language and communication, e.g. the game theory, but can be investi- gated as any behavioural coherence of communicative agents that have a historical identity and try to be successful in the main survival strategies, such as commonly reached coordination and organization (intraorganismic, interorganismic and transorganismic).

>With “communicative identity”, someone can differentiate signal-mediated inter- actions on every level of every organism of every kingdom. Additionally, it looks at the primacy of context dependence and—most importantly—of group identity (to belong or not to belong, i.e. self/non-self identification competence), and it investigates all semiochemicals in detail and in general. Clearly, “communicative identity” is absent in abiotic matter. No living agents, no sign-mediated interaction (communication) and no rules of sign use are present if water freezes to ice. A clear cut between living and non-living can be drawn here, from RNA groups up to humans.

>In contrast to the game-theoretical definition as strictly selfish-orientated behav- iour, meanwhile, we can assume that “communicative identity” means any behavioural coherence within the context of an ecosphere-specific real-life world. Because living organisms are no solus ipse entities, but, in most cases, interwoven in a social interacting network with same, related or non-related organisms, the communicative behaviour serves not only for selfish but essentially for common goals of participants of an ecosphere habitat with all its symbiotic repercussions.
