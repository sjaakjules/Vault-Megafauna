### Formal Characteristics

Floral traps in _Araceae_ where the sexual organs are enclosed and have complex movement and surface features. (A) Schismatoglottis type. The insects are retained by spathe movements; slippery surfaces are absent. (B) Arisarum type. An imperfect trap with a slippery spathe surface. Insects slip and fall into the spathe chamber but can escape unhampered by climbing the spadix or flying off. (C) Zomicarpa type. Insects are trapped inside the inflorescence by slippery surfaces and are released through a secondary exit formed by a movement of the spathe. **_(D) Typhonium type. Insects glide down slippery surfaces and are retained in the floral chamber by closure of the spathe constriction. During the staminate phase, the constriction reopens, and slippery surfaces cease to be slippery._** (E) Arum type. The insects are trapped by slippery spathe surfaces and sterile flowers on the spadix that partially occlude the spathe chamber. Insect release is facilitated by withering of the slippery organs. (F) Stylochaeton type. Insects are trapped by slippery spathe surfaces. In the pistillate phase, the spadix is enclosed in the spathe chamber. During the staminate phase, the spadix grows out of the chamber, and insects can escape via climbing.  
Gender symbols indicate pistillate and staminate phase of anthesis. Black arrows indicate arrival and departure of pollinators. Arrowheads indicate closure of the spathe constriction. The insect symbol indicates the pollinator’s residence during arrest. Asterisks indicate the presence of an intact slippery surface; crosses indicate that the slippery surface has withered and ceased to be functional.<sup>1</sup>
