## Meeting Thurs 20211022

### 1. More-than-human knowledge management as the ambition
Interspecies communities and relationships. We want to organise this knowledge. How do we cluster it/these?.  
Different things can be known. How does one glue this together, share and reuse? 

- Understand what the knowledge is
- Capture traces of it
- Organise the traces in some way
- Make sure the traces are just, are representitive
- Retain them and add to them
- Communicate these traces to others
    
In this domain:

- **Participation**: communication of knowledge
- **Place**: account of existing relationships and the actions possible based on these relationships (how things are situated)

TODO: define broader challenge / significance. 'Interspecies/ More-than-human Knowledge Management'

### 2. Knowledge Objects/Units

What forms can this knowledge take? Clusters of different, partial, problematic, heterogenous ways of storing knowledge. These knowledge objects can take the form of:
- knowledge processes (behaviour, evolutionary processes)
- compact processes (events)
- artefacts (books, digital datasets). 

Others:

- body shape (animal or tree)
- behaviour
- subjectivity and perception
- certain patterns of interactions (camoflauge, predator avoidance)
- data
- formal scientific hypothesis-testing
- indigenous story-telling.

This particular environment allows us to glue content together that is resolved at different levels, while still extracting this overarching story (needs ot be inclusive, participatory, action0-based).
Bits and pieces. Relationships between them.
- information (going down the graph)
- wisdom (going up the graph)

Stuff (?) flows through this, ie. love, beauty

TODO: SR - clarify what you mean by 'stuff flows through this, ie. love and beauty'

TODO: define broader account of knowledge clusters so we can link together our speculative imagination about parrots in 10,000 years with protests about indigenous mother trees with the terrestrial lidar scanning.

TODO: describe what types of clusters we are instantiating. These are just one of the bits...

### 3. Define Speech Agents/Speech Units

We want to include different stakeholders. Our system and appraoch doesn't have epistemic bias. It is agnostic to the source. The ambition is to allow anyone to speak (this speaking can be dreamy, statistical, as a scientific paper). 
The system is willing to consider at face value any contributions, and then reject those  it considers poor quality, or reject their use for a particular purpose. 
But the system is trying to account for them all and honestly. Tries to find what is good/caring/inclusive/just? and glues this together.

Emphasise the idea of speech or communicatiobn. Introduce agent who are speaking.

**Speech agents, ie:**

- artists would do some kind of actions, scientists would do others
- nonhumans can't but can engage it certain ways. We want to be inclusive so we want to consider it, even though we focus on human expert intepretation.

**Speech acts, ie:**

- technical operations
- but also poetic intepreations, multiple intepreations by different agents

We focus on  specific datasets and operations. 
We do this to provide glimpses in this overall way of inteperetting things in the domain of more-than-human research. 
This is instead of claiming these objects as significant outcomes in themselves (we are not ready for this).

TODO: SR - define this section better? Clearly distinguish the speech acts/agents from the knowledge objects.

TODO: consider how to show the technical stuff side-by-side with poetic intepretations (ie photos, videos...) 

TODO: investiate reveal.js and viscode.reveal for dissemination

### 4 Justify and Define Stories

Feedback in response to [[project-structure.framework#Stories]] **Stories**

Describe and identify the clear reason to tell stories. Increase/decrease friction between objects so a stakeholder might look at somethign they usually would not. 

- Understand briefly what existing stories exist in the human domain. Distinguish one story from another (poem, essay, an epic saga. All human and confined. Trans-species psychology).
- Show how our understanding of stories which includes nonhumans can be extended with somekind of systemicity to include these actors and speeches and objects
- Demonstrate that this story-telling can be systematic, substantiated and innovative compared with what exist now. Demonstrate we can tell from this approach are substantially different from those in the human domain (while retaining the power of storytelling, training and techniques)
- Demonstrate concrete benefits by focusing on particular stories  (benefits: new stakeholders, flexibility, empathy, capturing events otherwise unrecorded, ability to cope with time and spatial scales, ability to cope with non-individual life-forms, with subtle community relationships)
- Verifying. Return. Drop back into teaching situatione etc. Give back.

### 5. Addressing theme 'inclusiveness'

The exhibition as a living working exhibition. The planning, traces in dendron is all in the public domain. 
- sketch dissemination event
- document the disseminaton and record outcomes, report on this, re-integrate into the dendron/exhibition. 
- based on this  plan second event
  
TODO: sketch event, consider people, venues.
