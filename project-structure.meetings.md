## Broader Relationship to Place and Participation

### Place

- Places involve and are experienced by nonhuman as well as human entities
- Human centred places are unjust, degraded and un-viable.
- Yet, most places suffer human influence that cannot easily be withdrawn.
- Therefore, human designers have a responsibility to intervene in more-than-human places.

### Participation

- One typical approach to designing is the use of expertise.
- However, this approach is limited because of the constraints on human knowledge about natural systems.
- Another approach is participatory designing that involves nonhuman lifeforms and systems.
- This involvement is difficult because of varying evolutionary backgrounds, life histories, mutual (in)visibilities, and the inherently incompatible needs of different lifeforms.
- Human sensibilities, technologies, and languages do not suffice and should be informed by the input from nonhuman others.
- However, integration of nonhuman input is an open and difficult challenge.
- Information technologies can assist in resolving this challenge.

## Meeting Thurs 20211022

 ### 1. More-than-human knowledge management as the ambition

Interspecies communities and relationships. We want to organise this knowledge. How do we cluster it/these?.  
Different things can be known. How does one glue this together, share and reuse?

- Understand what knowledge is (patterns, data, information, knowledge, wisdom...)
  - Issue of knowledge and knowledge representation, communication (participation), retention (placement)
    - Subjectivity, points of view, biases, coupling, etc.
    - Incompleteness
    - Goal orientation and biases from that
    - Open possibilities for transspecies knowledge/communication
- Capture traces of it
- Organise the traces in some way
- Make sure the traces are just, are representative
- Retain them and add to them
- Communicate these traces to others

In this domain:

- **Participation**: communication of knowledge
- **Place**: account of existing relationships and the actions possible based on these relationships (how things are situated)

TODO: define broader challenge / significance. 'Interspecies/ More-than-human Knowledge Management'

### 2. Knowledge Objects/Units

What forms can this knowledge take? Clusters of different, partial, problematic, heterogenous ways of storing knowledge. These knowledge objects can take the form of:

- knowledge processes (behaviour, evolutionary processes)
- compact processes (events)
- artefacts (books, digital datasets).

- [ ] describe several compact but concrete examples @alexrfholland @sjaakjules

Others (cf. sensory ecologies, nonhuman cultures, nonhuman learning, etc.):

- body shape (animal or tree)
- behaviour
- subjectivity and perception
- certain patterns of interactions (camouflage, predator avoidance)
- data
- formal scientific hypothesis-testing
- Indigenous story-telling.

This environment allows us to glue content together content that is resolved at different levels and extract interesting stories (needs to be inclusive, participatory, action-based).
Bits and pieces. Relationships between them.

- information (going down the graph)
- wisdom (going up the graph)

Stuff (?) flows through this, ie. love, beauty

TODO: @SR-- - clarify what you mean by 'stuff flows through this, ie. love and beauty'

These are social constructs as concepts and performances as patterns of behaviour. They depend on those information exchange situated patterns. They can be presented as kinds of stories of one chooses. Probably not in this case.

TODO: define broader account of knowledge clusters so we can link together our speculative imagination about parrots in 10,000 years with protests about Indigenous mother trees with the terrestrial lidar scanning.

TODO: describe what types of clusters we are instantiating. These are just one of the bits.

- [ ] (you can put markers such as p or x into these todo labels) Anyway, please write the argument plan for this whole exhibition. Especially what is its unique benefit?

### 3. Define Speech Agents/Speech Units

We want to include different stakeholders. Our system and approach doesn't have epistemic bias. <!--- well, it does, unavoidably. the point is to highlight and resist it ---> It is agnostic to the source. The ambition is to allow anyone to speak (this speaking can be dreamy, statistical, as a scientific paper).

The system is willing to consider at face value any contributions, and then reject those  it considers poor quality, or reject their use for a particular purpose.

But the system is trying to account for them all and honestly. Tries to find what is good/caring/inclusive/just? and glues this together.

- [ ] can you illustrate these points with concrete examples from your selection?

Emphasise the idea of speech or communication. Introduce agents who are speaking.

**Speech agents, ie:**

- artists would do some kind of actions, scientists would do others
- nonhumans can't but can engage it certain ways. We want to be inclusive so we want to consider it, even though we focus on human expert interpretation. <!--- nonhumans definitely have speech of some kind. which? represented here how? --->

**Speech acts, ie:**

- technical operations
- but also poetic interpretations, multiple interpretations by different agents

- [ ] provide examples

We focus on  specific datasets and operations.

We do this to provide glimpses in this overall way of interpreting things in the domain of more-than-human research.

This is instead of claiming these objects as significant outcomes in themselves (we are not ready for this).

TODO: @SR-- - define this section better? Clearly distinguish the speech acts/agents from the knowledge objects.

TODO: consider how to show the technical stuff side-by-side with poetic interpretations (ie photos, videos...)

TODO: investigate reveal.js and viscode.reveal for dissemination

### 4. Justify and Define Stories

Feedback in response to [[project-structure.framework#Stories]] **Stories**

Describe and identify the clear reason to tell stories. Increase/decrease friction between objects so a stakeholder might look at something they usually would not.

- Understand briefly what existing stories exist in the human domain. Distinguish one story from another (poem, essay, an epic saga. All human and confined. Trans-species psychology).
- Show how our understanding of stories which includes nonhumans can be extended with some kind of systematicity to include these actors and speeches and objects
- Demonstrate that this story-telling can be systematic, substantiated and innovative compared with what exist now. Demonstrate we can tell from this approach are substantially different from those in the human domain (while retaining the power of storytelling, training and techniques)
- Demonstrate concrete benefits by focusing on particular stories  (benefits: new stakeholders, flexibility, empathy, capturing events otherwise unrecorded, ability to cope with time and spatial scales, ability to cope with non-individual life-forms, with subtle community relationships)
- Verifying. Return. Drop back into teaching situations etc. Give back.

### 5. Addressing theme 'inclusiveness'

The exhibition as a living working exhibition. The planning, traces in dendron is all in the public domain.

- sketch dissemination event
- document the dissemination and record outcomes, report on this, re-integrate into the dendron/exhibition.
- based on this  plan second event
  
TODO: sketch event, consider people, venues.
