# ISEA Theme Questions

Possibles not only open up an unfinished world of futures before us, but also presents and pasts behind us.

The Possible is openness and movement, a horizon of change that unfolds and organizes the world.

- What does it mean  to be a human now?
- How do we relate with the non-humans?
- How do we become bodies in the world?
- How do we construct and gain knowledge?
- How to develop the interaction between human and machine?
- And with the other animals?

## Ideas and Connections

- Endling is tragic but it is also not the end with traces, relationships, influences remaining. What are they? Examples?
- On the other hand, the living can be experientially, functionally, culturally impoverished or extinct, with important meanings and relations no longer actual or accessible. Examples?

## Knowing an Endling (Thematic Statement 200-500 words)

- [ ] Structure as an argument plan or at least as a research output. What is innovative? Why is this work significant? what are the benefits? Link explicitly to your PhD work.

>Endling (n.) The last surviving individual of a species of animal or plant. The National Museum of Australia

We focus on plants.

We focus on three cases where plants exist that are almost endlings:

- The first one represents the last of its species. Scientists keep the specimens in a lab and it is functionally extinct.
- The second one does not represent the last of its species but rather the last of its stage of life. This is the tallest flowering plant in the world – a Eucalyptus Regnans – in the remote wet forests of Tasmania.
- The third is mundane. This is not one organism but a collection of trees in the suburbs. Old trees are predicted to disappear here.

- [ ] Define forms of extinction and loss. Situate the examples within

Many of these endlings will go instinct – no matter what the intervention is.

One response to rapidly disappearing natural entities is to document and stand witness to then. To tell their stories.

This is difficult. Like all organisms, plants are complex… with many webs…

To try and capture and account for this, we explore new ways to collect data. Our ongoing research has collected high resolution volumetric data describing endling-adjacent plants  trees and we learn the ways to read their meaning.

This is a difficult challenge because elements of ecosystems mean different things to different inhabitants.

Responding to this challenge, we use laser scans in rainforests and data collected from particular accelerators, CT scanners, lidar…  We explore algorithms to recognise meaning in this data.

We do this to partake, engage and build comradery. We want to engage with this stuff and start taking account of it, externalise it and make it shareable (such as in an exhibition)

This exhibition is part of the broader idea who and what owns knowledge. We see knowledge as more-than-human and better understood as clusters that are different, partial, problematic, and heterogenous. Traces of these clusters can be expressed in genes, structures, patterns of behaviour, and cultures.

- [ ] Define knowledge appropriately and provocatively. Support

Our ambition is to account for the types of knowledge out there. Not in an exhaustive or philosophical way. But to capture the diversity, colour and excitement of it all. We want to instantiate this.

We do this for the purpose of ecocentric design that seeks to support all forms of life and life-supporting abiotic environments.

## Artwork Proposal (300-800 words)
 
The exhibit consists of three projections and one tablet.

We tell a story each about our endlings. Stories use photos, text and our data.

- [ ] Consider sound, we have some. I think provide an option of online. Also, state that this is embedded into the website of logic and stories as planned anyway.
- [ ] Provide a list (visual) or discoveries, innovations, unique observations, etc. and focus on some. Otherwise not clear what is of note here. Can have a table of thumbnails, etc.
- [ ] Consider telling each story through multiple eyes and with multiple tools. photo \ data graph \ plot \ map \ point cloud \ etc

## ENDLING 1:

Regnans (10 out of 20 tallest died in Tasmania bushfires in 2019)

Over 3 + 1 sites
- living regnans
- dead standing regnans
- dead collapsed rengans

- plus ex-situ scans in synchrotron

## ENDLING 2:

Stinklilly (only x remain)

- opening and closing the flower?

## ENDLING 3:

Yellowbox Woodland (97% gone)

- S M L trees
- bird vision?

## Research wall

Another component is a ‘research wall’ that provides a glimpse into the scientific evidence, the ethics, and the design of the installation. 

We map the stories and compare them to other stories.`

Show how we obtain the data.

## Artist Bio (300 words)

An academic at the University of Melbourne, Dr Stanislav Roudavski contributes to knowledge by using scientific evidence and advanced technologies in concert with cultural, political, and historical analyses.

Alexander Holland is a PhD candidate at the University of Melbourne. He investigates the digital and physical characteristics of contemporary environments and the design opportunities arising at their intersection.

Julian Rutten is a PhD candidate at Swinburne University of Technology. He studies the intersections of culture, nature, and technology.

## Key Concepts for the Conceptual Framework

## Knowledge

Here is knowledge. It comes in all these different forms. 

We understand that knowledge is better understood as clusters that are different, partial, problematic, and heterogenous. Traces of these clusters can be expressed in genes, structures, patterns of behaviour, and cultures.

## Knowledge Management

Our ambition is to account for the types of knowledge out there. Not in an exhaustive or philosophical way. But to capture the diversity, colour and excitement of it all.

We want to instantiate this. 

We do this to partake and engage and build comradery. We do want to engage with this stuff and start taking account of it, externalise it and make it shareable (such as this exhibition)

## Learning

## Story

We understand stories to be a sequence of events as they occur.

A story can happen to anything that travels through time (ie. a storm can have a story)

## Narrative

A Narrative is a way these events are communicated and told.

Inclusive interpretation: includes  meaning transfer, mutual influencing, meaningful sequencing are being appreciated and remembered

## Narrative Participants

### Step 1: Humans

Eco-literacy: humans training themselves to be less ignorant.

But with our data etc more subtle, the characters are being presented differently.

### Step 2: More Ambitious

Redefine narrative to say that it does not need to be announced as an artistic gesture that needs to be put into a certain performance – audience becomes different and more expanded.

Human-like animals. Some animals have the capacity to create and communicate narratives across species.

Create patterns for which the animals can engage.

### Step 3: Beyond This?

Is something else possible? Much more speculative. Different scales in size, in time, occur together, communicating together. There are all these stories and narratives around. We just do not listen to them

Slow down, intentionally pay attention. 

Provide some tools and techniques for these types of stories
- Tell stories to them
- Co-tell it with them
- Acknowledge that they already exist and they do not need humans to live their meaningful lives
