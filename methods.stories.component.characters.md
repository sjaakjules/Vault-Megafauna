## Plantae / E. regnans tree 
- Geological history: ice-age, drying out results in a mix between moist-loving remnant Gondwana species (ferns, myrtle, etc) and fire-loving eucalypts.
- Life relationships. Succession of this particular forest stand: microclimate means that this stand has had little disturbances for hundreds of years, resulting in a stand of giant e. Regnans trees.
- Epicormic competition between tree branches, bark streamers acting as kindling
- Stochastic disturbances: dead branches, decay.
- Interactions with humans: logging, activists, climate change, fires indigenous.

TODO: add epiphyte and fern characters

## Animalia / Athropods / Insect  
- Colonization of newly fallen limb, bark properties influence favorable or hostile environment.
- Migration into an existing rotten limb where previous bark properties influence existing communities and heart wood properties make environment favourable or hostile. 

## Animalia / Spider with web 
- Peeling bark create anchor points for web [1a: tree] 
- Foraging birds eat the spiders [3a: bird] 
- Wood boring insects are food for the spider [2a: insect] 
## Animalia / Mammalia / Bird 
- Use the dead and lateral branches in [1a: tree] for perching and resting 
- Use hollows in [1a: tree] resulting from [4a: fungi/bacteria] attack for nesting 
- Feed on [2a: insect] in bark streamers and substrate in [1a: tree] and the nectar provided by [1a: regnans] flowers.

TODO: add human character.
## Bacteria / Fungi? 
- Fungal or bacterial decay
