This note prepares materials for the review of more-than-human participation.

Cf.

- [[concept.participation]]
- [[approach.design.participatory]]
- [[approach.design.interspecies]], [[concept.design.ecocentric-design]], [[concept.design.ecocentric-design.how-to]]

## Definitions

### Agents

Who and how can participate. Human or nonhuman, living or nonliving, individual or collective.

### Design

- [[concept.design]]

### Participation

- [[concept.participation]]

### More-than-human participation

## Aspirations

- evidence driven
- real-world impact
- justice
- thriving

## Inclusions and Exclusions

Refer to the ladder and only include the rungs with the direct path towards commoning. Include approaches that aim to empower the decision-making by nonhuman beings. Mention and briefly discus but exclude artistic, evocative, metaphorical, critical and other approaches that fail to produce impact or do not empower nonhuman participants.

## Benefits

- fairness
- access to nonhuman expertise and innovation
- sustainability, biodiversity, health, resilience

## Challenges

- communication
- expensiveness
- time-consuming
- knowledge and skills
- ethics
- power dynamics
- cultural acceptance

## Practical examples

Create a grouping or a table of examples of more-than-human participation in design.

- by place
- by agents
- by degree of participation
- by impact
