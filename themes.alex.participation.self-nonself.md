>In symbiotic processes, species-specific communication competence has to be adapted to trans-species communication processes, which means that symbiotic processes depend on adaptation to signalling codes that transgress species borders in most cases. Natural codes function if three levels of rules are followed: syntactic rules determine coherent combination of signals, pragmatic rules determine how code-using agents interact according to changing contexts, and semantic rules determine which meaning/information can be transported with signals.

>As all more complex eukaryotes are colonized by symbiotic akaryote settlers that play vital roles for the benefit of their host, they must have adapted to the host ecology. This means they must be able to communicate within their population to coordinate, e.g. population growth, apoptosis, virulence, measurement, decision making, movement and election (quorum sensing), according to group signalling, which does not confuse similar molecules of other (non-self) communities. This seems rather difficult if we imagine, for example, 500 different bacterial species in the human oral cavity (Kohlenbrander et al. 2005). Besides, bacteria are overruled by viral settlers by a magnitude of 10 (Rohwer et al. 2014).

>Obligate persistent viral settlers of bacteria (phages) that integrate into host genomes must be competent to integrate without damage of the genetic content order and benefit for host capabilities to adapt to fast changing environmental contexts. As viral settlers are obligate in all living organisms on earth, symbiotic interactions represent multiple code compatibility between viruses, akaryotes and eukaryotic hosts (Diaz-Munos et al. 2017). To guarantee a highly sufficient population-based communication to coordinate appropriate group behaviour, a competence to differentiate self from non-self is necessary.

>In our context, this means that besides the epigenetic context, which is an essential tool for memory and learning capabilities, such contextual markings are also relevant for the reaction patterns on non-self organisms, even if they represent another species or even an organismic kingdom. The epigenetic marking of certain reactions or general behavioural patterns may affect the epigenetic markings of the symbiotic cooperation partner also. We may look here at the complexity of globally interwoven interactions between organisms of the same, related or non-related ecosphere habitats.
