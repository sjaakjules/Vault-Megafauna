What is knowledge? - body shape, behaviour, subjectivity and perception, patterns of interaction, data, scientific hypothesis, story telling.

This project is organised as four parts

### Research Cluster
TODO: rename research cluster - More-than-human knowledge management?


The research cluster is a hierarchically organised,  interconnected set of annotations, notes and documents. It is a cluster of knowledge, with information that flows through the cluster in particular ways. It is broken down into three major sub-clusters:

- [[admin.project-structure]]
- [[methods]]
- [[themes]]

The research cluster is hosted on github and uses the dendron framework.

### Source Environment

Instantiated / knowledge units / knowledge objects. Processes. Compat processes (eents). Artefacts (digital data).

The source environment is a multi-format, multi-scalar, semi-structured  dataset specific to a place. It is comprised of:

- [[methods.stories.component.stages.100km-biome.GIS]] data
- [[methods.stories.component.event.patterns.aerial-lidar]]
- [[methods.stories.component.stages.100m-forest-stand.terrestrial-lidar]] and [[methods.stories.component.stages.10m-organism.terrestrial-lidar-section]] sections
- [[methods.stories.component.stages.1m-organism-part.IMBL-high-energy]] tompgrahic data
- [[methods.stories.component.stages.1cm-near-surface.IMBL-low-energy]] tomopgrahic data

The source environment is also multi-format, supporting: 
  - images
  - gifs
  - links
  - embedded inline

The source environment is self-hosted using the potree and 3Js frameworks.

### Actions

Actions are metadata linking the research cluster with the source environment. Actions are described using the following [[project-structure.framework.markers]]:

- point cloud styling (point cloud files: colours, sizes)
- point cloud interactions (javascript: specify annotations, colours, lines, callouts, buttons, animations)
- point cloud location (xyz vector embedded within the URL).

Where possible, notes in the research cluster should be linked to the source environment with styling and location markers.

### Stories

Stories are paths through the project. They are  vehicles that can make the friction in the networks of relationships higher or lower, and filter what is being transmitted. 
- Stories focuses  attention, highlight certain relationships, encourage people to consider our core themes
- Stories have: characters, stages, event

They can take the form of

- freeform, exploratory  and DIY stories participants can construct for themselves by exploring the research cluster on GitHub
- videos, gifs and images,
