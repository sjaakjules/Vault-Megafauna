## Plantae / E. regnans tree

- Geological history: ice-age, drying out results in a mix between moist-loving remnant Gondwana species (ferns, myrtle, etc) and fire-loving eucalypts.
- Life relationships. Succession of this particular forest stand: microclimate means that this stand has had little disturbances for hundreds of years, resulting in a stand of giant e. Regnans trees.
- Epicormic competition between tree branches, bark streamers acting as kindling
- Stochastic disturbances: dead branches, decay.
- Interactions with humans: logging, activists, climate change, fires indigenous.

TODO: add epiphyte and fern characters

## Animalia / Athropods / Insect

- Colonization of newly fallen limb, bark properties influence favorable or hostile environment.
- Migration into an existing rotten limb where previous bark properties influence existing communities and heart wood properties make environment favourable or hostile.

## Animalia / Spider with web

- Peeling bark create anchor points for web [1a: tree]
- Foraging birds eat the spiders [3a: bird]
- Wood boring insects are food for the spider [2a: insect]

## Animalia / Mammalia / Bird

- Use the dead and lateral branches in [1a: tree] for perching and resting
- Use hollows in [1a: tree] resulting from [4a: fungi/bacteria] attack for nesting
- Feed on [2a: insect] in bark streamers and substrate in [1a: tree] and the nectar provided by [1a: regnans] flowers.

TODO: add human character.

## Bacteria / Fungi?

- Fungal or bacterial decay
