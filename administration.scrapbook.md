Knowledge is typically understood to be x. Other perspectives recognise that knowledge is not complete but instead emerges as clusters of different, partial, problematic, heterogenous ways of storing it. For instance, recent work emphasises the importance of interdisciplinary work (crossing scientific disciplines, crossing into the humanities, etc) for dealing with environmental challenges. Further research acknolwedges the diverse forms ecological knowledge can take, and the benefits of embracing these many different forms given that many ecological processes extend far beyond typical human timescales. For instance, knowledge about ecological management can take the form of formal scientific hypothesis-testing but is also retained and expressed in longer periods of time through practices such as indigenous story-telling and other cultural memories.

The next step is recognising that  clusters of knowledge are not limited to humans. Nonhumans have forms of knowledge too. Traces of these clusters -- or knowledge objects -- are expressed in genes, patterns of behaviour, and nonhuman cultures. The differences can be large due to different evolutionary backgrounds, life histories, mutual (in)visibilities, and the inherently incompatible needs of different lifeforms.
