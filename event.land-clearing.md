>A primary threatening process in temperate eucalypt woodlands is land clearing. Because the broad spatial distribution of temperate woodlands coincides strongly with the nation’s major wheat–sheep belts, much of the original vegetation cover has been cleared (Hobbs and Yates 2000). For example, only ~10% of temperate eucalypt woodlands with a grassy understorey remain uncleared in south-eastern Australia (Prober et al. 2012a). In the wheatbelt of Western Australia, ~90% of the vegetation – much of it temperate eucalypt wood- land – has been cleared (Gibson et al. 2004).
