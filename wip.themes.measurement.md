>Morphological traits of organisms, more than most other parameters, reflect the interaction between an individual's genetic background and the ecological factors it is confronted with. Thus, morphometric parameters are key elements in many ecological and evolutionary studies (e.g. Adams, Rohlf, & Slice, 2004; Bookstein, 1996; Chang & Alfaro, 2016). In traditional morphometrics, basic parameters such as distances, areas, widths, angles or derived ratios are analysed (e.g. Marcus, 1990). More sophisticated 2D geometric approaches quantify spatial patterns using landmarks, curves or outline analyses (e.g. Adams et al., 2004).

>In recent years, there has been considerable progress in 3D shape documentation—e.g. high-resolution computerized tomography, 3D scanning, or photogrammetry—and several 2D morphometric methods have been adapted accordingly (Márquez & Averbuj, 2016; Mitteroecker, Gunz, & Bookstein, 2005; Wiley et al., 2005). However, most traditional morphometric methods are not applicable to highly complex and irregularly formed organisms that lack landmarks or where the shape is highly variable (Martin-Garin, Lathuilière, Verrecchia, & Geister, 2007).

>Most habitats on the planet are surface habitats—from the abyssal trenches to the tops of mountains, from coral reefs to the tundra. These habitats exhibit a broad range of structural complexities, from relatively simple, planar surfaces to highly complex three-dimensional (3D) structures. Currently, human and natural disturbances are changing the complexity of habitats faster than at any time in history.

>Therefore, understanding and predicting the effects of habitat complexity changes on biodiversity is of paramount importance5. However, empirical relationships between commonly used descriptors of structural complexity and biodiversity are variable, often weak or contrary to expectation6,7,8,9,10. Moreover, there are no standards for quantifying structural complexity, precluding general patterns in the relationship between structure and diversity from being identified in different habitats.

>Fractal dimension quantifies space filling at different scales. Space filling promotes species coexistence by dividing surface area into a greater variety of structural elements, microhabitats and niches (for example, high and low irradiance, small and large spaces, fast and slow flow). This variety of niches allows species to coexist (for example, different competitors or predator and prey16) and therefore enhances biodiversity.
